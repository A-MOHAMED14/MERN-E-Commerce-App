## Description

TechHive is a full-stack e-commerce application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The app features a responsive user interface, allowing customers to browse products by category, add items to their cart, and securely complete purchases. It includes authentication, cart management with local storage, and Stripe integration for payment processing. The application also provides an admin panel to manage products, categories, and user orders.

## User Story

I want a smooth shopping experience that includes adding products to my cart, adjusting quantities, and securely completing my order.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Product Details**: Users can see detailed information about each product, including descriptions, price, and quantity available.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart, update product quantities, or remove items.
  Persistent Cart: The shopping cart data is saved even after refreshing or navigating away from the site.

- **Order Success Page**: After a successful purchase, users are shown an order success page and redirected to the home page.
